# DHP19
This is the repository for the Dynamic Vision Sensor 3D Human Pose Dataset (DHP19).

Dataset info and description are available on the DHP19 webpage https://sites.google.com/view/dhp19/home 

To generate the accumulated images and align the 3D labels, modify paths/parameters and then run the script `generate_DHP19/Generate_DHP19.m`

`heatmap_generation_example.ipynb` shows an example of how we generated 2D heatmaps from the 3D Vicon positions.
