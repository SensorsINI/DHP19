function info = ImportAedatHeaders(info)

%{
This is a sub-function of importAedat. 
This function processes the headers of an Aedat file. 
(as well as any attached prefs files). 
The .aedat file format is documented here:
http://inilabs.com/support/software/fileformat/

2015_12_11 Work in progress: 
	- Reading from a separate prefs file is not implemented yet.  
	- It would be neater (more readable) to turn the xml cell array into a
		structure.

This function expects a structure "info" with the following fields:
	- fileHandle - the handle of the file (useful for passing amongst
	subfunctions).
	- filePath (optional) - a string containing the full path to the file, 
		including its name. If this field is not present, the function will
		try to open the first file in the current directory.
	- source (optional) - a string containing the name of the chip class from
		which the data came. Options are (upper case, spaces, hyphens, underscores
		are eliminated if used):
		- file
		- network
		- dvs128 (tmpdiff128 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis - a generic label for any davis sensor
		- davis240a (sbret10 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis240b (sbret20, seebetter20 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis240c (sbret21 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis128mono 
		- davis128rgb (davis128 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis208rgbw (sensdavis192, pixelparade, davis208 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis208mono (sensdavis192, pixelparade accepted as equivalent)
		- davis346rgb (davis346 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis346mono 
		- davis346bsi 
		- davis640rgb (davis640 accepted as equivalent)
		- davis640mono 
		- hdavis640mono 
		- hdavis640rgbw (davis640rgbw, cdavis640 accepted as equivalent)
		- das1 (cochleaams1c accepted as equivalent)
		If class is not provided and the file does not specify the class, dvs128 is assumed.
		If the file specifies the class then this input is ignored. 
	- startTime (optional) - if provided, any data with a timeStamp lower
		than this will not be returned.
	- endTime (optional) - if provided, any data with a timeStamp higher than 
		this time will not be returned.
	- startEvent (optional) Only accepted for fileformats 1.0-2.1. If
		provided, any events with a lower count that this will not be returned.
		APS samples, if present, are counted as events. 
	- endEvent (optional) Only accepted for fileformats 1.0-2.1. If
		provided, any events with a higher count that this will not be returned.
		APS samples, if present, are counted as events. 
	- startPacket (optional) Only accepted for fileformat 3.0. If
		provided, any packets with a lower count that this will not be returned.
	- endPacket (optional) Only accepted for fileformat 3.0. If
		provided, any packets with a higher count that this will not be returned.
		
The output is the same "info" structure; it has the following additional or 
	updated fields:
	- fileFormat - i.e. Aedat format version (double). 
	- source (string) - as derived either from info.source or failing that, 
		from the file. In the case of multiple sources, this is a horizonal 
		cell array of sources in order. 
	- dateTime - a string encoding the start date and time of the
	recording.
	- endEvent - (for file format 1.0-2.1 only) The count of the last event 
		included in the readout.
	- endPacket - (for file format 3.0 only) The count of the last packet
		from which all of the data has been included in the readout. 
		Packets partially read out are not included in the count - this
		is necessary to implement incremental readout by blocks of
		time.
	- xml (optional) any preferences included in either the header of the file
	or in an associated prefs file found next to the .aedat file. 
	- beginningOfDataPointer - an integer
